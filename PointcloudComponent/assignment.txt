Assignment: Colorized Point Cloud Visualization

Objective:
In this assignment, you will use the DepthAI SDK to create a Python script that generates a colorized point cloud from stereo depth data and visualizes it using the DepthAI viewer.

Requirements:
1. Install the DepthAI SDK on your system.
2. Connect an OAK device with stereo and color camera capabilities to your computer.
3. Create a Python script that accomplishes the following:
   - Initialize an OakCamera object.
   - Create a color camera instance using the `camera()` method.
   - Create a stereo depth instance using the `create_stereo()` method.
   - Configure the stereo depth to align with the color camera using the `config_stereo()` method.
   - Create a point cloud instance using the `create_pointcloud()` method, specifying the stereo depth and color camera for colorization.
   - Visualize the colorized point cloud using the DepthAI viewer.
   - Start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.
4. Test your script to ensure it runs without errors and displays the colorized point cloud in the DepthAI viewer.

Hints:
1. Use the `oak.camera()` method to create a color camera instance. Pass 'color' as the argument to specify the color camera.
2. Use the `oak.create_stereo()` method to create a stereo depth instance.
3. Use the `stereo.config_stereo()` method to configure the stereo depth. Set the `align` parameter to the color camera instance to align the depth data with the color camera.
4. Use the `oak.create_pointcloud()` method to create a point cloud instance. Pass the stereo depth instance as the `stereo` argument and the color camera instance as the `colorize` argument to enable point cloud colorization.
5. Use the `oak.visualize()` method to visualize the colorized point cloud. Pass the point cloud instance as the argument and set `visualizer='depthai-viewer'` to use the DepthAI viewer.
6. Use `oak.start(blocking=True)` to start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.

In this ASCII art visualization:
1. The OAK Device is represented by the top block, which contains the Color Camera and Stereo Depth instances.
2. The color camera data and stereo depth data are sent to the Point Cloud Colorization component.
3. The Point Cloud Colorization component generates a colorized point cloud by combining the depth data with the color information.
4. The colorized point cloud is sent to the DepthAI Viewer, represented by the bottom block.
5. The DepthAI Viewer displays the colorized point cloud.

The arrows represent the flow of data from the color camera and stereo depth to the point cloud colorization, and from the point cloud colorization to the DepthAI viewer.
