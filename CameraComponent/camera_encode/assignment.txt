Assignment: Encoded and Non-Encoded Video Streaming

Objective:
In this assignment, you will use the DepthAI SDK to create a Python script that demonstrates video streaming with both encoded (H.265) and non-encoded frames from a color camera.

Requirements:
1. Install the DepthAI SDK on your system.
2. Connect an OAK camera to your computer.
3. Create a Python script that accomplishes the following:
   - Initialize an OakCamera object.
   - Create a color camera stream with H.265 encoding.
   - Visualize the encoded color camera stream with a scale of 2/3 and display the frames per second (FPS).
   - Visualize the non-encoded color camera stream with a scale of 2/3 and display the FPS.
   - Start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.
4. Test your script to ensure it runs without errors and displays both the encoded and non-encoded video streams.

Hints:
1. Use the `oak.create_camera()` method to create a color camera stream. Pass 'color' as the first argument to specify the color camera. Set `encode='h265'` to enable H.265 encoding for the color camera stream.
2. Use the `oak.visualize()` method to visualize the encoded color camera stream. Pass `color.out.encoded` as the argument to access the encoded output of the color camera. Set `fps=True` to display the FPS and `scale=2/3` to scale the visualized stream.
3. Use another `oak.visualize()` method to visualize the non-encoded color camera stream. Pass `color` as the argument to access the non-encoded output of the color camera. Set `fps=True` to display the FPS and `scale=2/3` to scale the visualized stream.
4. Use `oak.start(blocking=True)` to start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.
