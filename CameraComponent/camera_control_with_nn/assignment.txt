Assignment: Face Detection and Camera Control

Objective:
In this assignment, you will use the DepthAI SDK to create a Python script that performs face detection on a color camera stream and automatically controls the camera's exposure and focus based on the largest detected face.

Requirements:
1. Install the DepthAI SDK on your system.
2. Connect an OAK camera to your computer.
3. Create a Python script that accomplishes the following:
   - Initialize an OakCamera object.
   - Create a color camera stream.
   - Create a face detection neural network (use 'face-detection-retail-0004') and attach it to the color camera stream.
   - Configure the camera to automatically control exposure and focus based on the largest detected face.
   - Visualize the face detection results.
   - Display the frames per second (FPS) on the visualized output.
   - Start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.
4. Test your script to ensure it runs without errors, detects faces in the camera stream, and automatically adjusts the camera's exposure and focus based on the largest detected face.

Hints:
1. Use the `oak.create_camera()` method to create a color camera stream. Pass 'color' as the argument to specify the color camera.
2. Use the `oak.create_nn()` method to create a face detection neural network. Pass 'face-detection-retail-0004' as the first argument and `color` as the second argument to attach the neural network to the color camera stream.
3. Use the `color.control_with_nn()` method to configure the camera to automatically control exposure and focus based on the face detection results. Set `auto_focus=True` and `auto_exposure=True` to enable automatic focus and exposure control, respectively. Set `debug=False` to disable debug mode.
4. Use the `oak.visualize()` method to visualize the face detection results. Pass `face_det` as the argument to visualize the output of the face detection neural network. Set `fps=True` to display the FPS on the visualized output.
5. Use `oak.start(blocking=True)` to start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.
