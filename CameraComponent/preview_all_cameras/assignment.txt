Assignment: Multi-Camera Visualization with Maximum Resolution

Objective:
In this assignment, you will use the DepthAI SDK to create a Python script that captures and visualizes frames from all available cameras on the OAK device at their maximum resolution.

Requirements:
1. Install the DepthAI SDK on your system.
2. Connect an OAK camera to your computer.
3. Create a Python script that accomplishes the following:
   - Initialize an OakCamera object.
   - Create camera streams for all available cameras using the `create_all_cameras()` method with the resolution set to 'max'.
   - Visualize the camera streams.
   - Display the frames per second (FPS) on the visualized output.
   - Start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.
4. Test your script to ensure it runs without errors and displays the camera streams from all available cameras at their maximum resolution.

Hints:
1. Use the `oak.create_all_cameras()` method to create camera streams for all available cameras. Pass `resolution='max'` as the argument to set the resolution of the camera streams to their maximum supported resolution.
2. Use the `oak.visualize()` method to visualize the camera streams. Pass the `cams` variable as the argument to visualize all the created camera streams. Set `fps=True` to display the FPS on the visualized output.
3. Use `oak.start(blocking=True)` to start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.

In this ASCII art visualization:
1. The OAK Camera is represented by the top block, which contains multiple cameras (Camera 1, Camera 2, Camera 3, Camera 4).
2. Each camera is configured to capture frames at its maximum supported resolution.
3. The captured frames from all cameras are sent to the Visualization component, represented by the bottom block.
4. The Visualization component displays the camera streams (Camera 1 Stream, Camera 2 Stream, Camera 3 Stream, Camera 4 Stream) in a grid layout.
5. The FPS (frames per second) is displayed within the Visualization component.
