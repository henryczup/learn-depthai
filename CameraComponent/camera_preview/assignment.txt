Assignment: Stereo Depth Estimation and Visualization

Objective:
In this assignment, you will use the DepthAI SDK to create a Python script that performs stereo depth estimation using left and right cameras, and visualizes the color, left, right, and depth streams.

Requirements:
1. Install the DepthAI SDK on your system.
2. Connect an OAK camera with stereo capabilities to your computer.
3. Create a Python script that accomplishes the following:
   - Initialize an OakCamera object.
   - Create a color camera stream.
   - Create left and right camera streams.
   - Create a stereo depth estimation using the left and right camera streams.
   - Visualize the color, left, right, and depth streams with a scale of 2/3 and display the frames per second (FPS).
   - Start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.
4. Test your script to ensure it runs without errors and displays the color, left, right, and depth streams.

Hints:
1. Use the `oak.create_camera()` method to create camera streams. Pass 'color' as the argument to create a color camera stream, 'left' for the left camera stream, and 'right' for the right camera stream.
2. Use the `oak.create_stereo()` method to create a stereo depth estimation. Pass the `left` and `right` camera streams as arguments to specify the left and right cameras for stereo depth estimation.
3. Use the `oak.visualize()` method to visualize the camera streams and depth output. Pass a list containing `color`, `left`, `right`, and `stereo.out.depth` as the argument to visualize the color, left, right, and depth streams. Set `fps=True` to display the FPS and `scale=2/3` to scale the visualized streams.
4. Use `oak.start(blocking=True)` to start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.
