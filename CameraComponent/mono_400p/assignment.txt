Assignment: High FPS Stereo Camera Visualization

Objective:
In this assignment, you will use the DepthAI SDK to create a Python script that captures and visualizes high FPS (60 FPS) stereo camera streams from the left and right cameras.

Requirements:
1. Install the DepthAI SDK on your system.
2. Connect an OAK camera with stereo capabilities to your computer.
3. Create a Python script that accomplishes the following:
   - Initialize an OakCamera object.
   - Create left and right camera streams with a resolution of 400p and a frame rate of 60 FPS.
   - Visualize the left and right camera streams.
   - Display the frames per second (FPS) on the visualized output.
   - Start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.
4. Test your script to ensure it runs without errors and displays the left and right camera streams at 60 FPS.

Hints:
1. Use the `oak.create_camera()` method to create camera streams. Pass 'left' as the argument to create the left camera stream, and 'right' for the right camera stream.
2. Set the `resolution` parameter to '400p' and the `fps` parameter to 60 when creating the left and right camera streams to specify the desired resolution and frame rate.
3. Use the `oak.visualize()` method to visualize the camera streams. Pass a list containing `left` and `right` as the argument to visualize the left and right camera streams. Set `fps=True` to display the FPS on the visualized output.
4. Use `oak.start(blocking=True)` to start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.
