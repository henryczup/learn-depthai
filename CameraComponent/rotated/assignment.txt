Assignment: Visualizing Rotated Camera Streams

Objective:
In this assignment, you will use the DepthAI SDK to create a Python script that captures and visualizes frames from all available cameras on the OAK device, with the camera streams rotated by 90 degrees.

Requirements:
1. Install the DepthAI SDK on your system.
2. Connect an OAK camera to your computer.
3. Create a Python script that accomplishes the following:
   - Initialize an OakCamera object with the `rotation` parameter set to 90.
   - Create camera streams for all available cameras using the `create_all_cameras()` method.
   - Visualize the camera streams.
   - Display the frames per second (FPS) on the visualized output.
   - Start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.
4. Test your script to ensure it runs without errors and displays the rotated camera streams from all available cameras.

Hints:
1. Use the `OakCamera(rotation=90)` constructor to initialize the OakCamera object with a rotation of 90 degrees.
2. Use the `oak.create_all_cameras()` method to create camera streams for all available cameras.
3. Use the `oak.visualize()` method to visualize the camera streams. Pass the `all_cams` variable as the argument to visualize all the created camera streams. Set `fps=True` to display the FPS on the visualized output.
4. Use `oak.start(blocking=True)` to start the camera pipeline in blocking mode.

In this ASCII art visualization:
1. The OAK Camera is represented by the top block, which is configured with a rotation of 90 degrees and contains multiple cameras (Camera 1, Camera 2, Camera 3, Camera 4).
2. The captured frames from all cameras are rotated by 90 degrees and sent to the Visualization component, represented by the bottom block.
3. The Visualization component displays the rotated camera streams (Camera1 (Rot90), Camera2 (Rot90), Camera3 (Rot90), Camera4 (Rot90)) in a grid layout.
4. The FPS (frames per second) is displayed within the Visualization component.

The arrow between the OAK Camera and the Visualization component represents the flow of rotated data from the cameras to the visualization.
